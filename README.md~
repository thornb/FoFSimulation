Friend of Friend Simulation

Simple Simulation called "newSimulation.py" in the 2013-milgram-project-new folder uses the data from the former project and performs its own simulation based on the data from the gowalla network.

It does distance routing based on the closest "friend of friend" to the goal that it sees. 

## Instructions

Please call program with <type of simulation> <start node> <end node> <max hops> <knowledge>"

type of simulation: "distance" or "random"
start node: number node to start route from. 0 is random
end node: number node as goal to reach. 0 is random
max hops: max number of hops before ending simulation
